##The model
<div class = "white">
For the John Hopkins Data Science Specialisation I made a text prediction model.
The capstone project is the result of a collaboration between the university
and SwiftKey. The aim of the project was to create a light weight model to predict
text input, for example to be used on your phone.

My model was largely based of the Katz's back-off model(1). This model states
that for n-grams ('n' sized word combination) with a frequency below a certain
threshold, smaller n-grams should be applied to look for better matches. The 
threshold in my model where choosen based on the amount of n-grams needed to 
cover 50% of total n-gram use. N-grams of size six to two were used in my model.

##The data
<div class = "white">
The main dataset on which the model is based, was provided by SwiftKey. They supplied us with extracts from
twitter, blog and American newspapers. Only a small part of the supplied data
was used due to limited processing power and RAM on my end.

To increase to accuracy of my model I added all English idioms on Wikipedia to the 
matching dataset.(2) As there were only roughly 8000 idioms on Wikipedia at the
time of creation this did not slow down the prediction speed.
